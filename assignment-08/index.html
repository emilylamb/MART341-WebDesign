  I said to you, "Why did you do it?"
Touch the glass, I'll feel ya through it
Against the wall with the bracelets on
You look bizarre in the apricot
You think that you're Space Ghost
You're wanted coast to coast
Fuck that shit, now I go
My way and you go yours
Gotta be all that coco, ayy?
Playin' too much of that GTA
Playin' too much of that Dr. Dre
Doom, Quake, where'd you get the gun from, eh?
Really think that metal gonna make you safe?
Playing peek-a-boo with the devil these days
Black cap back with a trench coat, ayy
Living in the valley cuttin' porno tapes
You think that you're Space Ghost
You're wanted coast to coast
Fuck that shit, now I go
My way and you go yours
Were you bored of gender norms?
Of being alone, no mama home
A bad divorce, or sad we can't
Afford the clothes our heroes own?
Remember when you stole
Mom's old Geo Metro
You wore her old bath robe
Too small to see the road
We were just two Texas toddlers
Pokémon and bottle rockets
Dunkaroos, and Real Monsters
Capri Sun straw in the bottom
You think that you're Space Ghost
You're wanted coast to coast
Fuck that shit, now I go
My way and you go yours
Heard you were lookin' up the cookbook, names
Cut into the back of your bedroom door frame
Super villain with a manifesto, dang
Gotta say I'm pretty glad they caught you, man
Get back to the kickball days
Scared to hold hands at school disco days
007, Nintendo, James
Bond, Hot Pockets in the microwave
You think that you're Space Ghost
You're wanted coast to coast
Fuck that shit, now I go
My way and you go yours
