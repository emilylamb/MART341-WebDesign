Using the way back machine I went to UBL.com which is Ultimate band list, it sold tickets to concerts like Marilyn Manson and Radiohead, This is from December 27, 1996. This site does not exist anymore.
I learned how to move things from atom to git hub. I'm confused on how to link one html into another and how to properly format those files.
